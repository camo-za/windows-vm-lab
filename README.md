# 💻 VirtualBox VM Lab – Windows Client & Server Administration

This project showcases the complete setup, configuration, and administration of a **Windows 10/11 client environment** and a **Windows Server 2022 Active Directory domain**, all built and documented using **Oracle VirtualBox**.

It forms part of my **CompTIA A+ certification study**, hands-on technical development, and preparation for an **IT Support / Junior SysAdmin role**.

## 🖥️ Virtual Machines Created

### **🖼️ Windows Client VM — Windows 10 & Windows 11**

This project began with a Windows 10 VM (**Sections 0–3**) and was later rebuilt on Windows 11 (**Sections 4–7**) for improved performance and updated tools.

All tasks align with **CompTIA A+** and beginner **SysAdmin** objectives.

### **Windows 11 (Sections 4–7)**

- Installed from clean Windows 11 Evaluation ISO  
- Practised core networking commands (`ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`)  
- Used administrative tools:  
  - Windows Update  
  - Restore points  
  - File History  
  - Firewall  
  - Defender  
  - UAC  
- Explored security basics and administrative utilities
